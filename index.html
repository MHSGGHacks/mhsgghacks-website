        <span>What's a hackathon?</span>
        <span>
          A hackathon is an event where people of all skill levels can come together to create a project
          and develop computer science skills. Any student can come to a hackathon to see how their interests meet technology and collaborate
          with other enthusiastic students to build an innovative and exciting project.

      <div class="body question">
        <span>Wait... what makes GGHacks so special?</span>
        <span>
          GGHacks is a special type of hackathon. While other hackathons are
          focused strictly on serious projects, GGHacks encourages creativity
          and non-traditional thinking by rewarding humor and less serious
          entries.  GGHacks is a place to let loose and have some fun with
          like-minded hackers.
